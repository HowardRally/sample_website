    <h1>The Learn enough story</h1>
    <p>The Learn enough is a leader in the movement to teach <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take command of your computer and get it to your bidding. This includes googling error messages, and knowling when to just robbt the darn thing. We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more. <a href="http://learnenough.com/email">Sign up for our official email list</a> </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
